This workshop is very similar to https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/tableau-intro and https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/tableau-dashboard . The example data in this workshop use "Canada's Core Public Infrastructure Survey - Public Use Microdata Files (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/34-25-0001/342500012025001-eng.htm)" instead of a COVID dataset. We also combined both workshops to streamline user experience.
